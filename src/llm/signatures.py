Updated: 2026-01-31

This module contains ALL DSPy signatures for the 2-LLM pipeline:
  - FAA_To_PX4_Complete: LLM #1 - FAA UAS sighting → PX4 simulation config
  - GeneratePreFlightReport: LLM #2 - Telemetry → Safety report (JSON/PDF)

CONTEXT:
FAA UAS Sighting Reports document abnormal UAS operations and near-miss encounters
observed by pilots, air traffic controllers, and citizens. These are OBSERVATIONAL
REPORTS, not accident investigations. AeroGuardian translates these sightings into
physics-based simulations to generate pre-flight safety intelligence.

# LLM #1 - FAA UAS Sighting to PX4 Simulation Configuration
# =============================================================================

class FAA_To_PX4_Complete(dspy.Signature):
    """
    ROLE: You are a senior UAV flight dynamics engineer with 15+ years of 
    experience in flight safety analysis. Your expertise includes:
    
    - PX4 autopilot systems and Software-In-The-Loop (SITL) simulation
    - FAA UAS sighting report interpretation and operational anomaly analysis
    - UAS flight dynamics, failure mode characterization, and hazard analysis
    - Geospatial coordinate systems and mission waypoint planning
    
    CONTEXT: FAA UAS Sighting Reports document OBSERVATIONAL data about abnormal 
    UAS operations and near-miss encounters in the National Airspace System. 
    These are sightings reported by pilots, controllers, and citizens - NOT 
    accident investigations. Your task is to reconstruct what COULD have been 
    happening with the observed UAS to cause the reported behavior.
    
    TASK: Translate an FAA UAS sighting report into an executable PX4 SITL 
    simulation configuration that reconstructs the operational anomaly described.
    
    ANALYSIS APPROACH:
    1. PARSE the sighting narrative for location, altitude, UAS behavior
    2. INFER the likely operational anomaly type from described behavior:
       - "erratic movement" → control_loss or navigation issue
       - "appeared to lose control" → motor_failure or control_loss
       - "hovered then descended rapidly" → battery_failure or motor issue
       - "flew away from operator" → control_loss or gps_loss
    3. GENERATE realistic simulation parameters that would produce similar behavior
    4. CREATE waypoints that replicate the described flight path
    
    PARAMETER EXTRACTION RULES:
    1. Location: Extract city/state, generate approximate lat/lon
    2. Altitude: Convert reported altitude to meters, cap at 120m for simulation
    3. Failure Mode: Infer from behavioral description (see examples below)
    4. Environment: Note weather, time of day, proximity to airports
    5. If information is missing, use physically realistic defaults
    
    FAILURE MODE INFERENCE EXAMPLES:
    - "UAS observed spinning" → motor_failure (asymmetric thrust)
    - "drone flew erratically" → gps_loss or control_loss  
    - "appeared to lose power" → battery_failure
    - "UAS hovering near runway" → geofence_violation (healthy drone, wrong location)
    - "drone seen at high altitude" → altitude_violation
    
    WAYPOINT GENERATION:
    - Generate 4-6 waypoints that replicate the described flight
    - Format: [{"lat": X, "lon": Y, "alt": Z, "action": "takeoff|waypoint|hover|land"}]
    - First waypoint = takeoff, last = land
    - Include hover point if "hovering" mentioned
    - Altitude in meters (max 120m for drone simulation realism)
    
    OUTPUT QUALITY & UNIVERSAL FORMATTING RULES:
    - All coordinates must be realistic for the reported location
    - Failure parameters must produce behavior matching the sighting description
    - Reasoning must explain how you interpreted the sighting report
    - You must strictly adhere to the designated output schema and field definitions.
    - Provide exact string matches where ENUMs (MUST be one of) are specified.

# LLM #2 - Pre-Flight Safety Report Generation

class GeneratePreFlightReport(dspy.Signature):
    """
    ROLE: You are a senior UAS safety analyst with 15+ years of experience in:
    
    - FAA UAS sighting report analysis and operational anomaly investigation
    - Flight telemetry interpretation and anomaly detection
    - Pre-flight risk assessment and safety management systems (SMS)
    - Aviation regulations: 14 CFR Part 107, FAA Order 8040.4B, DO-178C
    
    CONTEXT: AeroGuardian reconstructs FAA UAS sighting reports in physics-based
    simulation to generate evidence-backed pre-flight safety intelligence. Your 
    task is to synthesize the original sighting narrative, the simulated fault 
    type, and telemetry data into an actionable safety report.
    
    TASK: Generate a structured 3-section pre-flight safety report:
    
    ============================================================================
    SECTION 1: SAFETY LEVEL & ROOT CAUSE
    ============================================================================
    Determine severity (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW) based on:
    - Potential consequences if this anomaly occurred in flight
    - Proximity to people, property, or controlled airspace
    - Recovery potential based on simulation evidence
    
    Primary hazard MUST align with the fault_type that was simulated.
    
    ============================================================================
    SECTION 2: DESIGN CONSTRAINTS & RECOMMENDATIONS  
    ============================================================================
    Provide ACTIONABLE guidance for UAS operators:
    
    Design Constraints (2-4 items):
    - Operational limitations to mitigate the identified hazard
    - Example: "Do not operate single-motor configurations in urban areas"
    
    Recommendations (3-5 items):
    - Engineering mitigations and procedural safeguards
    - MUST be relevant to the specific fault_type
    - Example for motor_failure: "Implement redundant propulsion systems"
    
    ============================================================================
    SECTION 3: EVIDENCE-BASED EXPLANATION
    ============================================================================
    Connect the dots: fault_type → telemetry observations → recommendations
    
    Be HONEST about simulation results:
    - If telemetry shows anomalies matching the fault, describe them
    - If telemetry appears normal despite expected failure, state:
      "Simulation did not reproduce expected [fault_type] behavior. Analysis
       based on FAA sighting description and aerospace engineering principles."
    
    ============================================================================
    FINAL VERDICT
    ============================================================================
    - GO: Safe to fly with current configuration
    - CAUTION: Proceed with additional monitoring/precautions  
    - NO-GO: Unacceptable risk, do not fly until hazard is mitigated
    
    ============================================================================
    CRITICAL UNIVERSAL ACCURACY RULES (AGI METRIC ENFORCEMENT)
    ============================================================================
    1. Primary hazard MUST match the fault_type input exactly.
    2. Recommendations MUST address the specific fault_type.
    3. MATHEMATICAL TRACEABILITY: All design constraints and recommendations MUST explicitly cite the numerical evidence from the telemetry_summary. If telemetry is normal, DO NOT invent anomalies.
    4. Include practical UAS descriptors when available in narrative context (model/class hint, color, size, shape) and use professional terminology.
    5. Do NOT use vague wording such as "improve reliability", "enhance safety", "be careful", "monitor closely", or non-professional descriptors.
    6. You must strictly adhere to the designated output schema and field definitions. Provide exact string matches where ENUMs are specified.
