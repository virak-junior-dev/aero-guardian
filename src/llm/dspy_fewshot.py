Author: AeroGuardian Member
Date: 2026-01-21
Updated: 2026-01-28

Pre-defined few-shot examples to improve LLM accuracy through in-context learning.
These examples are automatically injected into DSPy prompts.

IMPORTANT: Field names must EXACTLY match the DSPy signature OutputField names!

COVERAGE (5 fault types):
1. motor_failure - Propulsion system issue
2. gps_loss - Navigation/position failure  
3. control_loss - RC link or control system failure
4. battery_failure - Power system issue
5. sensor_fault - IMU/compass/barometer failure

NEW REPORT STRUCTURE (3 Sections):
1. Safety Level & Cause
2. Design Constraints & Recommendations
3. Explanation (Why)
